# UB-Campus-Safety

The University of Belize grapples with a multifaceted challenge regarding the safety and security of its faculty, staff, and student body due to the absence of an integrated and user-friendly campus safety application. While the university employs certain safety precautions, they are not optimized to meet its community's dynamic and evolving safety needs. The existing measures lack the seamless ease of use, instantaneous information sharing, and personalized support that a comprehensive safety app could provide. Consequently, there is a growing demand among stakeholders for a centralized platform that enables swift responses to crises, disseminates pertinent safety information, and delivers timely notifications.
